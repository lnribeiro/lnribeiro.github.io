Hey, welcome to my personal blog! üòÅ

You may find posts about topics of my interest, including: math, signal processing, software development, data science, history, among others. 

### Short Bio

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Wireless Communications Research Group (GTEL)](https://gtel.ufc.br) of the [Federal University of Cear√°](https://ufc.br), Fortaleza, Brazil.

I received my Bachelor degree in Teleinformatics Engineering from the [Federal University of Cear√°](https://ufc.br) in 2014, and my Master degree in Informatics from the [University of Nice Sophia Antipolis](http://unice.fr/), Sophia Antipolis, France, in 2015. 

In 2014, I was a research assistant at the [I3S Laboratory](http://i3s.unice.fr) working with tensor decompositions applied to the analysis of atrial fibrillation electrocardiograms. In 2017, I was a visiting researcher at the [Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion](https://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/christian-doppler-laboratory/) of Technische Universit√§t Wien, Vienna, Austria. There I investigated novel transceiver systems for modern wireless communications systems.
