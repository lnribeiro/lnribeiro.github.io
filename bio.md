I grew up in [Fortaleza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortaleza), a city in the northeastern brazilian coast.

I lived in [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice), France, in 2013-2014 and in Vienna, Austria, in 2017.

I now live in Fortaleza and work on my Ph.D. 

### Academic

I received my Bachelor degree in Teleinformatics Engineering from the [Universidade Federal do Ceará](https://ufc.br), Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2014. The lectures I took are mainly concentrated in signal processing and telecommunications subjects. My Bachelor's thesis title (in Portuguese) is "Separação cega de fontes: métodos e aplicações" and can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/monografia.pdf). During my undergraduate studies, I was awarded a "scientific initiation" scholarship by [CNPq](www.cnpq.br) and [CAPES](www.capes.br).

In 2013, I was awarded a scholarship from the Brésil France Ingénieurs Technologie ([BRAFITEC]()) program to follow the Master's program in Informatics at the polytechnic school of [Université Nice Sophia Antipolis](http://www.polytech.unice.fr), Nice, France. The BRAFITEC program allowed me to follow this Master alongside with my bachelor's studies. Besides learning french, I took lectures in machine learning, image processing, etc. In 2014, I was a research assistant at the [I3S Laboratory](http://i3s.unice.fr) working with tensor decompositions applied to the analysis of atrial fibrillation electrocardiograms. I was supervised by [Vicente Zarzoso]() and [Gérard Favier](). My Master's thesis title is "Tensor models applied to atrial fibrillation analysis" and can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/rapport.pdf).

In 2015, I joined the [Wireless Research Telecommunications Group](www.gtel.ufc.br) (GTEL) at the [Universidade Federal do Ceará](www.ufc.br) to follow another Master degree, now in Teleinformatics Engineering, where I was supervised by [André L. F. de Almeida]() and [João César M. Mota](). At the beginning of 2016, I defended the thesis named "On supervised multilinear filtering: applications to system identification and antenna beamforming". The dissertation pdf can be found [here](http://www.repositorio.ufc.br/bitstream/riufc/16516/1/2016_dis_lnribeiro.pdf).

Just after defending the Master's thesis, I joined the Ph.D. program at the same institution. My research subjects include: transceiver design, array processing, tensor signal processing, among others.

In 2017, I was a visiting researcher at the [Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion](https://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/christian-doppler-laboratory/) of [Technische Universität Wien](www.tuwien.ac.at), Vienna, Austria. There I investigated novel transceiver systems for modern wireless communications systems. I was supervised by [Stefan Schwarz]() and [Markus Rupp]().

I expect to defend my Ph.D. thesis by the end of 2019.

### Personal

I also enjoy reading (sci-fi, history, fantasy, etc), practicing sports (mainly swimming and cycling), playing video and board games, cinema, traveling. I maintain a curated list of websites related to maths, science, engineering, programming, sysadmin, productivity and lifestyle [here](https://github.com/lnribeiro/curated_bookmarks).
