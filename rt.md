### Research

I am interested in signal processing, wireless communications, and machine learning. I am also an enthusiast of R and Python for data analysis.

### Teaching

As a Ph.D. student, I have experience as a teacher assistant in the Telecommunications Engineering undergraduate course at Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza. My assistance consisted basically  of giving some lectures, preparing and correcting exams, etc. I have assisted in the following lectures:

* Digital signal processing (2018.1, 2019.1)
* Digital communications systems (2018.2)

### Presentations

I also gave some talks and tutorials:

* Introdução à esteganografia digital com Python ([slides](https://github.com/lnribeiro/setic2015/blob/master/Introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20%C3%A0%20Esteganografia%20Digital%20com%20Python.pdf) and [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/lnribeiro/setic2015/blob/master/esteganografia.ipynb)) -- SETIC'15, UFC, Fortaleza, Brazil
