It's a pleasure to share that our papers [Low-complexity separable beamformers for massive antenna array systems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-spr.2018.5115) and [Separable linearly constrained minimum variance beamformers](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.12.010) have been accepted to be published! 

These papers are fruits of my PhD research where we propose low computational complexity beamforming methods for large-scale antenna arrays. Such methods may be of interest for new generation mobile communication systems (5G, for example), radio-telescope array systems, etc. 

So far, the performance of the proposed methods was analyzed considering rather idealistic assumptions, such as perfect array separability and absence of antenna coupling. In upcoming work, we intend to assess the proposed methods under more realistic scenarios with the aid of electromagnetic field simulator software.
