On August 6th, 2019, I presented the lecture "Transceiver Design for Large-Scale Systems" at the [TU Munich-Universidade Federal do Cear√° Workshop on Signal Processing for Wireless Communications](http://www.msv.ei.tum.de/workshop-tum-ufc/). I discussed multilinear filtering techniques to solve large-scale filtering problems, as well as transceiver schemes for millimeter wave MIMO systems.

The presentation slides are available [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/tum19.pdf).
